Bollywood is a genre of Indian cinema that typically features lavish, colorful and extravagantly stylized productions. The term &ldquo;bollywood&rdquo; is derived from the Urdu word &ldquo;buxar&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;the world of motion pictures.&rdquo;
The industry has been around for more than 50 years and has produced some of the most popular films in India. Some of the biggest names in Bollywood include Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Jay Chou and Hrithik Roshan.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://indiaglitz.github.io/tags/bollywood/>Bollywood</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://indiaglitz.github.io/posts/bts-jungkook-twitter-account/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bts Jungkook Twitter Account - Bts Alone Walk Never Photoshoot Album</span></a>
